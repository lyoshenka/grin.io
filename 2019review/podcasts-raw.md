## conv Tyler year in review 2019

How to stay productive while traveling: either stick to a rigid schedule, or train yourself to produce no matter what circumstances you’re in

Also, don’t underestimate the value of doing different work in different locations. Eg having multiple offices or only writing in coffee shops. 


## conv Tyler Patrick collison zuck progress 

### What Tyler looks for

People who are curious. People who have bold ambitions. People who have what I call stamina — they just don’t even stop. People who are working in productive small groups that maybe through WhatsApp, in fact, or it could be their next door neighbors, their colleagues at a university. When those, say, four items come together, then I think you have possibly what is a very good funding decision, and I would take a lot of chances on those people, not worry too much about the micromanaging, and let talent rip and let groups form and see what happens.

Also, vision. There has to be a vision, and there are plenty of successful entrepreneurs who are not curious. So for intellectual progress, to really put curiosity very highly is part of my philosophy.

### why the important things (rent, healthcare, education) are getting more expensive, not less

I think there are common features to these problems, though each one is different. Restrictions on entry is one, highly bureaucratized institutions. High entry costs. Sometimes a lot of third party payment — which may be required in the case of catastrophic healthcare, but it nonetheless has distorting effects. Areas where people have very strong moral feelings I think we often make worse decisions about. We’re not analytical enough. And you put all of those together.

### historic examples of high productivity

Patrick: Look at Vienna, 1880 to 1940 or something. In so many different fields you have people who do this incredibly informative work: Klimt and you had Mahler and you had Mach in physics and you had, of course, Austrian economics and von Mises and Hayek and all the rest and you had Freud and you had Wittgenstein. Vienna was amazing in this period. And when you dig into the specific stories you realize a lot of these people knew each other and they were inspired by each other.

Tyler: also lots of immigration in those areas

### misc

Tyler in why no one studies things like coat disease: The incentive is to build a brick that can survive scrutiny by referees. It’s not to build a building. So we have tons of bricks and few buildings. 

Patrick: tool building is clearly under-supported

Mark on CZI: 4 years is still too early to tell what’s working. I don’t wanna judge too early and end up thrashing. So I encourage my teams to do things that clearly would not happen otherwise 

Studying data that exists vs trying experiments and generating new data that doesn’t exist yet 

Tyler: the tenure system discourages risktaking

Tyler: all Econ students should spend two weeks in a poor village at part of their training. Just go there, observe, and think. 

**Me: Managers could be WAY better. How do they know they’re doing well?**


## Morgan Housel on What Other Industries Teach Us About Investing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wml0xO4cG8g

investing is the only field where a complete novice can outperform the best-trained, best-experienced ppl

investing is about human behavior

"It's more productive to read *around* one's field than *in* one's field"

5 stories that are not directly about investing but relate to investing. 

### 1

Nuclear power

Not everyone views risk rationally or the same way. A lot of your risk judgements are influenced by the culture you live in, your values, the generation you were born in, etc. 

Individual's willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.

Hindsight (the ability to explain the past) gives us the illusion that the world is understandable and make sense (even when it doesnt). People are "great" at explaining the past, but terrible at forecasting the future. 

To mitigate this:
- talk to as many people as you can
- talk to people you disagree with (helps with confirmation bias)
- talk to ppl who are in different emotional states than you are

### 2

war on cancer

we assume that if it's more complicated, its more effective.

smart ppl want to do what's intellectually stimulating, but that may be less effective than the simple things

how to succeed at investing (the simple, effective version)
- spend less than you make
- save the difference
- buy a diverse portfolio of great companies
- be patient

berkshire hathaway charges no fees, which amounts to a huge part of it's outperformance of other funds. but that gets overlooked because its not exciting.

munger: most ppl don't copy berkshire because their model is too simple. most ppl believe you can't be an expert if its too simple.

the more educated you are, the more likely you are to discount the simple things


### 3

terrorism

more americans died in 2002 trying to avoid terrorism than died in 2001 from terrorism (because americans started flying less and driving more, and driving is **way** more dangerous)

direct risk: the obvious stuff
indirect risk: when our actions to respond to that risk backfire on us

the market generally does great. don't sell when scared. have a long-term view

volatility is the cost of admission for being in the market

eisenhower on genius: "the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind"

you don't have to be great. just don't screw up when it matters most

### 4

politics

the market is extremely hard to forecast

foolproof investing formula: Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth +/- Change in Valuations. But its impossible to predict Change in Valuations. that's just about how people feel. can't measure that.

ben graham: "the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary"

### 5

wright brothers

no one covered their achievement when they managed to fly. no one was paying attention. people thought it was a waste of time.

eventually people caught on but it took years

the wright brothers were the least qualified and had the least money. but they had the most patience to grind it out. 

patience and long-term thinking is more important that creativity and intelligence

"When innovation is measured generationally, results should not be measured quarterly"

long-term doesn't mean 2-5 years, it means 20-50 years.

### summary

the biggest risk to you as an investor is yourself. and that's great. you can't control most things, but you can control your own behavior. 



## knowledge project - Scott Adams

A really good episode overall. Above avg for this podcast. 

He interviewed naval??


Media training tips
- you don’t have to answer the question. You just have to be interesting. If you don’t like or understand the question, talk about what you want to say. 
- don’t say things that make you look bad when taken out of context

Most important thing he learned in life: people are 90% not rational, but they rationalize things to themselves. Just assume that ppl are irrational most of the time and make predictions/decisions based on that. This is how hypnotists see the world backwards. 

Loserthink book: there’s no such thing as nonfiction. You cannot write objectively about reality. Not possible. Everyone writes their version of the truth. 

The most common explanation for something you don’t understand is something you’ve never heard of. 

Occam’s razor works in science but not with ppl. Ppl can’t tell which solution is simplest. Everyone thinks their fav solution is simplest. You don’t know what you don’t know. Eg sunk costs - if you’re never heard of it, you won’t know you’re missing it. But once you hear that, it’s a useful tool for your thinking. You just have to be exposed to it

Ppl don’t like to be shown that their current worldview is ridiculous. 

Shane: were not running our brains in debug mode. 

To fix others thinking:
- pacing - matching the other person) agree as much as you can, then when you disagree they’ll know you’re mostly in agreement
- put disagreement in the form of questions. Ask them to clarify. Let them expose their own problematic thinking
-  from Annie duke: you’re never 100% sure of anything
- outcome over ego. Best outcome
- work on reducing someone’s confidence about their opinion instead of talking them out of their opinion directly (eg all the experts agreed on this nutrition thing but they were wrong, or the whole in the ozone layer)
- track when you’re wrong

The magic question: state one thing that you believe (on a topic of disagreement) that you think I do not believe. Great question to ask when you think they are disagreeing with a misrepresentation of your beliefs.


## Tim Ferriss - Charles Koch 

Focus on attacking the problems, not attacking the people

He echos that hardship is extremely important for success 

Biggest influences: Maslow, Hayek 

Maslow: what you can be, you must be. If you don’t work to fulfill your potential, you’ll be deeply unhappy. 

Hayek: ppl can live together in peace and prosperity under simple general rules 

Other influential authors: Karl popper, mises, 

“Science is falsification” - essay by popper 

Look for key drivers of success, the get ppl to tell you how each one might go wrong

Michael Polanyi- “the republic of science”. Science is done by consensus and knowledge sharing. That’s why it’s so good. 

Polanyi “Personal knowledge” - big difference between personal knowledge and conceptual knowledge. First you learn the parts (he calls it personal knowledge, I call that tacit knowledge), then you focus on the whole. First you learn to play the violin, then you focus on beautiful music. 

F.a. Harper, Eugene Deming

Division of labor by comparative advantage. Focus on what you’re great at, then trade for the rest. That optimizes everything. 

Creative destruction. Don’t be protectionist in your own shop. Similar to innovators dilemma. Constantly replace what you’re doing with something better. 

Maslow’s “synergy”. A state of mind where what’s selfish and unselfish merge. Help others in a way that rewards you. It’s not always true, but seek to maximize that at every level (personal, society)

Free speech, property rights, decision rights. 

Mises: human action model. Ppl will act when 1) they are dissatisfied with the current state, 2) they see a better state, 3) they have a clear path toward the better state. 

A good partnership requires three things: shared vision, shared values, and complementary abilities.





## idea machines - Alexey guzey 

More people should ask themselves the question “what is my comparative advantage? “ what am I suited to do? how can I best contribute to the world?

The world should fund more  crackpots. Higher variance in research

## knowledge project - Daniel Gross

What drives curiosity is the feeling that you’re safe to go explore something and that you’ll be rewarded for exploring it.

A lot of catalyzing moments that create enduring curiosity begin with a small positive feedback from someone you admire. How do we scale that up?

Most really grand things start out extremely small. Any startup that goes on to be huge was once very small and insignificant. Decisions that end up being huge are often though tto be small at the time you make them. Sometimes (e.g. government projects like going to the moon) you can know at the beginning that you're gonna be doing something massive. But usually you can’t. Snowball effects are everywhere.

The ultimate metric: cultivate a group of people that you really care about, and ask them if what you’re doing is "good". This is a lagging indicator but it’s a gut check that your life is headed in the right direction.

How to create luck for yourself: 
- step one: keep a lookout for opportunity. Think of it like walking around the earth with a metal detector. Keep your eyes and ears open your things going on
-  step two (this is the hard part): when you notice that opportunity, when that metal detector goes off, you have to go for. 
-  Most people, when they have the opportunity, they go back to their current local maximum where they are comfortable. But you have to do the psychologically hard thing and seize the opportunity. Have your "iphone moment". Do something that’s a little scary, doesn’t align that well with your metrics, but has a huge opportunity for upside.

To reinvent yourself, you have to cannibalize existing business models and channel resources towards things that don’t really make sense at first but may pay off longterm.

Culture is built during times of scarcity. It’s hard to build culture during times of plenty. So if you had a period where you were struggling or almost bankrupt, then you have a strength that came out of that time. Whereas if you’ve always been lucky or successful, you may not have the experience of struggling, and therefore you may not have that strength. It's hard to be very successful if you've never struggled.

Question for Dan: he says that Apple is an example where they gave up short term wins for a long term incentive (by focusing on privacy instead of mining user data). But then he says they did it while thinking that they can win in other ways. So that’s not really an example of a long-term incentive. That’s them choosing to forgo a short-term gain because of their values. (tbh Dan does say that you have to already be in a strong position to do this, and that apple would not have stuck with this value if they were about to go bankrupt)

Common theme: hardship is necessary for sucess.

He talks a lot about how everything is a game and you're trying to get points.

### How to become a better leader

- ability to distance emotions and thought patterns from your actions (e.g. mindfulness). ability to play life in 3rd-person
- ability to figure out when you're acting out of insecurity. lots of people have deep insecurity. be aware of yours.
- ability to be vulnerable. don't just talk about it. vocalize your worries to your team. don't bottle it up. treat others as adults.
- reverse-engineer the leaders you look up to
- sleep is super-important. never work so much that you're not sleeping well. the meta-problem of productivity is fixing sleep.
- sense of real empathy for the ppl you work with. learn their stories. it helps you motivate them and design the "game of work" better for them.

### what do you feed your brain

- the brainwashing effect of books is strong. when Dan is doing something hard, he reads lots of books about it. it helps him get interested in the hard thing.
- the main thing is to read a lot, but don't make yourself finish books. read whatever's interesting now. if you start to lose interest, just drop it.
- dan cycles between longform content based on his current state: books, podcasts, etc.
- fiction books inject information at a deeper level about how the world works. he tries to read lots of ficiton
- mental models from fiction:
	- from ender's game (and harry potter): interesting that the children are in charge
	- from harry potter: the strength of made-up tribal bonds (the houses, the sorting hat, virtue signaling of the houses, the games they play that reinforce their values/bonds)

### how do you change how you think

- books are not that good at changing opinion
- people you're surrounded by do much better (the micro-influencers, the ppl that arent globally known but matter a lot to you)
- your tribe and your micro-influencers have root access to your brain. they get around your firewall easily
- the world is a tree of influence. to change the world, traverse the tree and change the opinions of the people that many others admire
- to be more openminded, think about how do you respect someone who has a totally different mindset than you? try to find interest in the other side. imagine them as an emergent property of "the system", and figure out how they became who they are and how did they develop their opinions. 
- everyone is locally rational, even terrible ones

### misc

when building software, do your best to figure out the human goals of your users and align them with your organization's goals. otherwise you may be incentivizing your users to do things that don't overlap well with their real goals (e.g. answering a ton of emails in gmail vs accomplishing real work by answering the 4 important emails)

to Dan, happiness is flow + improving the lives of others

successful ppl get stuck in a tight, positive feedback loop. they do something useful, get affirmation from ppl they care about, and iterate.

the most important intervention is to change the loop.




## The Portal - Eric Weinstein & Timur Kuran - preference falsification 

Happens when it’s not safe to express private preferences publicly and accurately. Ppl may express the opposite preference, or they may pick an extreme instead of nuanced position in the middle. This leads to collective outcomes that are against the majority’s wishes, and to outcomes that no one predicted. 

This state can end (or overcorrect) when everyone realizes that there is much more support for their position than they expected (eg the slow clap). 

Danger can be physical violence or reputational/psychological violence. 

Examples: fall of communism, saddams rise to power, James damore. 

Read: gauged reference theory, preference incoherence, pref. falsification, George Soros has one, Paul Samuelson’s Nobel prize speech, hyperbolic discounting

Revealed preferences + pref. falsification = ???



## James Clear & Cal Newport

### Difference between distraction via Facebook vs distraction via Slack

Facebook is specifically designed to suck up your attention. Its weaponized cognitive science research in service of their bottom line. Slack distraction is more about knowledge workers not knowing how to create value and optimize their process of value creation. Our world of internet-connected knowledge work is a new thing. In manufacturing, there is a well-understood system of defining a process, measuring, and optimizing. But many knowledge workers avoid creating a process or fight concrete goals. But you can’t improve until you have a well-defined process that can be measured and optimized.

(Grin: _Make Time_ is that process. Consciously choose a highlight, set aside focused time to do it, grade yourself every day, and tweak your process regularly)

### Communicaton

When it comes to communication, clarity trumps responsiveness. If the people you communicate with know what to expect from you about how you'll communicate (e.g. when you'll respond to messages, when they get to ask questions, etc), that’s more important for them than you answering every email right away.

### Recovery

You can't deep work all the time. Even the top violin players do at most two blocks of two hours of pure focus a day. And they are concentrating much harder than most writers or programmers. Even when a writer does a 5-hour chunk, they often pause and take small breaks here and there. During the rest of your time, you also need solitude (freedom from output of other minds) and leisure time (time spent on anything but work). For solitude, you don’t have to be in full on meditation (that's another form of focus). You can just take some time alone to go for a walk or do an errand without your phone. Related: [focused vs diffuse thinking](https://fs.blog/2019/10/focused-diffuse-thinking/).

### The downside of good habits

The more a habit becomes part of your identity, the more you do it on autopilot and the harder it become to notice how you can be better. You have to regularly get back into beginner mind and see yourself with fresh eyes.

### Continuous improvement

Self-improvement is a continuous process, a loop. You have to have self-awareness (aka beginner mind) to notice what is wrong or what needs improvement, and then you have to have deliberate practice to improve on that. The deliberate practice becomes a habit which then becomes part of your identity. Then you complete the loop by finding the next one percent to improve or the next area to work on.

### Misc

[Monk mode](https://gregmckeown.com/the-magic-of-being-in-monk-mode/) in the morning. Be in solitude until noon.
 
James points out that high-achievement individuals spend a lot of time planning their time. They may spend several hours each week on planning. Meshes well with a comment from Tiago Forte in another podcast that the weekly review is a the most important habit in his system.



## Knowledge Project - Johnathan Haidt


https://heterodoxacademy.org/mill/ - John Stuart Mill’s Ideas on Free Speech Illustrated

Recommends reading Barry Schwartz and Philip somebody regarding wisdom and common sense vs coddling and deferring to policy.

Recommends teaching cognitive behavioral therapy to everyone. Even if you're not depressed, its a great set of tools for improving your life.

**You have to share my ideas with other people and let them disagree with you in order to learn. Otherwise you're staying stupid.**

---

According to Haidt, universities are used to making accomodations for students that request them. And this has basically become a policy to the point where no one asks "do you really need this accomodation or should you suffer the consequences and learn from it". Administrators defer to policy and laws instead of making a judgement. This is strangling us.

---

Be wary of people who participate in callout culture, who don't assume good intentions, don't give the benefit of the doubt, who immediately jump to seeing the worst in others. They can destroy an organization that depends on psych safety, cooperation, creativity, playfulness (aka a startup). How to avoid hiring people who are bad at cooperating and will not give others the benefit of the doubt?

How to reduce the fear of being attacked by callout culture? Can I seek out groups that want me because I'm willing to disagree well?

---

Something he learned from "How to Win Friends and Influence People": If you respond to something you disagree with by first saying “Well that’s an interesting idea. Here’s where we agree and here's something that resonates with me. But I’m not sure about this other thing. What about blah blah?“ Then you’ll be much more likely to have a productive discussion and maybe even change someone’s mind.

---

Talk to Diana about how much we resolve Zoya's sharing conflict with other kids. Maybe let her do more of it herself instead of always jumping in and telling her the right way to share or play together or take turns.


## Knowledge Project - Barbara Oakley - Learning How To Learn 

All learning is just creating a new pattern in your brain.

How to practice : look on what hurts the most and focus on that.

Learning about focus thinking versus diffuse thinking helps inoculate you against thinking that you’re stupid while you’re learning. If you can’t figure something out by focusing, take some time off and let you refuse thinking process in the background. Then when you come back to it, you’ll be much more ready to keep learning.

The best solution to procrastination is the Pomodoro technique. Focus intently for 25 minutes, then reward yourself at the end. The reward part is very important because it trains you to enjoy the whole process.

Exercises and very important part of learning. Physical activity causes your brain to release brain derived neurotrophic factor. That helps your neurons make new connections and grow. Physical activity is a great way to take a break from focusing.

Focus meditation is great for training your focus, but it may inhibit default mode network activity in your brain. It’s important to spend at least some time thinking random things and let your brain relax and be in a default mode. Don’t spend all your time focusing really hard. That may inhibit creativity.

Memorization gets a bad rap these days, but we should not ignore it. Sometimes you just have to memorize stuff. If you try to understand something a bunch of different ways, it can be more confusing than understanding it one way and building on it.

She recommends Kumon for kids. She thinks public schools don’t like kids practice enough. Smartick is another good option that’s online.

Never just look at something and think to yourself “oh I know that”. Always test yourself. Always test the illusion that you understand something just because you’re familiar with it. And then make sure that after a long day of learning you get plenty of sleep. 



## Awakening from the Meaning Crisis (episode 2)

requirements for flow:
- the challenge of the task is well-matched to the participant’s skill level (too easy = boredom, too hard = anxiety)
- clear information
- immediate, tightly coupled feedback
- error really matter

why do people rock climb? its a great way to get into flow

being in flow leads to insight cascades. in climbing: you get stuck, then you change your framing of the problem to gain insight, you try a new approach, you move on to the next problem.

video games are also a great flow inducer.

humans love being in flow. its addictive.

shamans use their rituals (sleep deprivation, fasting, social isolation, meditation, chanting, dancing, psychadelics) to get into a flow state

humans are very very good at picking up on complex patterns in the environment. intuition is the result of implicit learning. you don't know how you learn the complex patterns, but you do. 

bigotry = picking up on correlational patterns instead of causal patterns

you cannot replace implicit learning with explicit learning. that usually causes worse performance. but you can create an environment to foster implicit learning.

the requirements to foster implicit learning are the same as the requirements for flow

shamans get into flow, get insight cascades, get enhanced implicit learning (picking up on real, complex patterns). insight and implicit learning reinforce each other. you get insight, get more learning, get new insights.

challenge: the insights are implicit. you cannot verbalize them. how do you explain them to others?

metaphor is extremely pervasive in our language. all of our cognition is filled with metaphor. (read Metaphors We Live By)

metaphor is how you make creative connections between ideas

by generating metaphors, the shaman improves our ability to make sense of the world, literally making more meaning.

---

literacy enhances our thinking and enables metacognition

no one finds the epic of gilgamesh relevant to their lives, but many read the ancient greeks, romans, confuscius, buddha, etc. something happened during 300-800BC that changed the way people think and write. 

the mind is your worst enemy and your greatest ally. undisciplined thinking leads to self-deception and violence. disciplined thinking leads to self-correction, self-transcendence, and wisdom.


## True north podcast - Dave Perell and Mason Hartman

- winning in nature is more valuable than winning socially. Nature does not have kid gloves. In nature, no one “decides” that you did a good job. You either fall out of a tree or you don’t. 

- obsession is the key to resilience and overcoming big obstacles. Kids who are obsessed will power through. If you’re not, you’ll just give up. 

- humans are really good at remixing, but it’s hard to start with a blank page and “be creative”. You need constraints that limit you enough to be creative. You look at the obvious options within the constraints, and you decide you don’t like any of them. Then you think “what else can I do”.

- Helping someone raise their ambition is very high-leverage for society. It costs little but is super beneficial. Surrounding yourself with ppl who see tremendous potential in you is huge. 

- if you can get a grant to work on something, that means you should not work on that thing. you have to jump through so many hoops and get approval for your idea, that its gonna come out so watered down that all the really new and interesting stuff will be cut out

- the Bay Area is one of the few places where people can have high status even though they've "failed" a lot. but failure has to be ok if we want real progress and innovation. 

- lesson from David Deutsch: don't work on something unless you really want to. if you don't want to work on something, don't do it. he believes this is fundamental to being human. 

- Powerful idea: sovereignty. treat children as if they are independent, sovereign beings. its ok to disagree with others. don't feel pressure to agree just to be socially nice.

- The key to asking very insightful questions: a) listen deeply and actively, b) at the same time, run a simulation in your mind of a version of you where this topic is the thing you care about the most. get very curious, then notice where you are confused and ask about that. if you notice that you're confused, then either your model of the subject is inaccurate and you need to update, or the person talking to you (or the whole field) has missed something. pair extreme curiosity with extreme loving scepticism, and focus on whats most interesting/exciting/insightful for the other person and only focus on that. remove your ego.


## True north podcast - Dave Perell and Eugene Wei 

our brains are very visual. It’s a lot easier to communicate something visual. Young kids growing up these days, because they have smart phones, communicate much better visually that we can. In the future Visual communication might be taught the same way that reading and writing is taught today.

Evolutionarily, humans are very visual learners. Any memory competition will involve people in coding information submit it to visual form.

Kids are taught visually. Adults, for some reason, don’t learn that much visually but instead learn by reading. Visual learning is very underrated. Just following around a very successful person is a great way to learn what they do. For example, watching chess players play, athletes, shadowing a CEO, twitch improving video game players.

Visualization really works. 

Intellectuals are biased against visual and narrative learning. 

----

First principles thinking requires raw data, not compressed data. This is why Jeff Bezos banned PowerPoint. PowerPoint is compressed data, while writing is more raw. Writing also helps you clarify your thinking.

On the other hand, when Jeff communicates the company, he must do so and a most compressed and memorable way possible. Information distortion is one of the big challenges of communicating in a large organization. There are lots of tricks such as rhyming alliteration repetition and so on to help you communicate something in a memorable way. Good communicators use them often.

There is lots of room for first principles thinking and improvement in organizational design. Most organizations are not public with the way they do things, a lot of it is received wisdom. The most successful organizations do a lot of things wrong but their success what’s the paper over it. For example the way meetings are run, the way teams communicate.

## conversations with tyler - neal stephenson

COWEN: How did you train yourself to learn storytelling?
STEPHENSON: I think that part of it begins with empathy because, in order to tell somebody a thing, you need to know and understand what it’s like to not already know that thing, which seems kind of obvious.

## a16z podcast - tyler cowen interviews the founders

Ben: Truly great managers have two features: 
- strong systems thinking (second-order effects, complex interactions, etc)
- strong ability to understand and model the thinking of people who are not like you (empathy, personality theory)

Marc: Let the users innovate. All the best ideas came from users.

Ben: Quote from Kanye West - "Time is luxury"



## modern wisdom - tiago forte

- weekly review is the keystone habit. it's good for habit reasons to actually do it weekly at the same time, but it doesn't have to be. it can be done whenever you notice that you're not sure what you should be doing next
- +1 for inbox zero
- digital productivity pyramid: digital fluency (using technology efficiently), task management & workflow (basically GTD), habit formation and behavior change (getting yourself to do GTD and stick to the processes you design), personal knowledge management (his Building a Second Brain course, using the processes you've created to recall information, synthesize it, and create something new), JITPM (just-in-time project management)

## your parenting mojo - father's role in parenting

https://yourparentingmojo.com/fathers/

- the primary attachment is about who's best meeting your needs
- attachment is complimentary. in traditional familiies, parents tend to specialize in what they provide and what needs they meet (and meeting all needs is important).
- mothers typically provide comfort when distressed and meet social/emotional needs. fathers typically provide security and freedom to explore. if zoya's upset, she might want mom. if she's scared or wants to play, she may want dad.
- even if secondary attachment (dad) is solid, zoya may still prefer mom. from her point of view, it may be that there's less certainty in some activity (e.g. she's taken more baths with mom, so she's much more sure about what to expect). even if the last 10 baths with dad were fine, she still prefers mom. reasoning with her ("you took a bath yesterday and it was fine") does not work.
- to remedy this, two options. a) do more baths with dad so she gets used to it. b) have mom present but had dad doing the primary work. this provides reassurance.
- with same-sex parents, attachment heirarchy is about whether the parenting roles are more traditional (one provides more emotional support vs the other) or more equal.
- children's expectations of their parents’ behavior are based on their typical interaction with that parent. if parents provide in non-traditional ways, thats fine.
- father's rough-and-tumble play and "scary" games may help in cultures with more competition. also more rough-and-tumble play leads to less agression with peers (maybe by praticing being in and responding to such situations)
- reflective function / attunement: awareness in a parent of their own feelings and thoughts while engaged with their child, but also their awareness of the child's feelings and thoughts
- attunement is somewhat biological/cultural, but can also be learned. (grin: is this similar to EQ or active listening?)
- don't sneak away to do work as soon as zoya is quiet/happy. that's the best time to engage with her - when she doesn't need you to meet any of her other needs.
- > when children are distressed, well, when any of us are stressed, the first thing we want is an emotional connection. We want someone to be responsive to that, not to solve our problem or to fix or even distract us with humor. They want us to recognize what they're feeling, acknowledge those feelings and after that happens that actually helps our brains calmed down a bit so that then we might be able to move on to, well what could we do differently or perhaps some problem solving
- > you can't change your children's attachment preferences or that hierarchy, but the hierarchy is based on the sort of routine or typical responses to children's attachment needs. And what moves you to the top of the hierarchy is sensitive prompt responses that are in line with what the child wants
- top of heirarchy changes throughout life. it may start with mother, then move on to close romantic relation or best friend, and eventually come back to father. or it may move in other ways. again, its about who's meeting your needs best.
- > child perceives that being asked to take a bath with the non-preferred parent is a distressing event ... it's not really about the bath, it's about resolving that newly felt distressed even if she wasn't distressed until that moment.
- attachment is lifelong. even adults have attachments. it might be more complex or to more people, but we also want different people at different times. so its no different with our kids.
- childrens (and adults) sometimes switch. it can happen when children move into preschool because they have fewer physical needs that need to be met so they can start to feed themselves and clothed themselves, bathe. And now it's more about exploring and seeking opportunities outside the immediate family in which fathers tend to take more of a role.
- > when fathers are more secure with their partners, then the children tend to be more secure with the fathers. also, if fathers believe "we're doing this together" and "we're on the same page" with their partners and they felt supported in the way they parent, that's also predictive of secure attachement to children. 
- if there's gatekeeping (A tries to do a task, B says "stop, I got it, don't bother"), that's not beneficial for the child
	- as child gets older, fathers can settle into a role where they do lots of activities with the child, but they never talk about child's emotional needs. this can be caused by father always overreacting, or never bringing the issues up, or not wanting to talk about it. this can lead to a shallow relationship.

Learn to get In touch with your subconscious 

You will know you did it if you are surprised. Surprise is a sign that your model of the world is wrong. Learn to love that and look for it.

Look for “gold” in things that don’t make sense. When people say that something doesn’t make sense, what they really mean is that their logic conflicts with reality, And they are choosing their logic over a reality.

### investing

Trading in the market is about anticipating others anticipation. 

“Intrinsic value” is not real. theres no such thing. Value is subjective, someone’s opinion. And even *if* it were real, it would not matter. the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. 

When traders take a position, they are expressing an opinion about the future. When opinions of different classes of investors diverge, that’s an opportunity (if you know which class of traders is right). 

In general, the closer to “reality”, the more right they are. E.g. metal traders > stock traders > currency traders. Metal is used in manufacturing, currency is just numbers. Below currency is economists, below them is politicians/Fed. 

[In fact any human activity can be viewed as an opinion about the future. Human brains are prediction machines. Learn to understand human behavior to predict the future.]

Understand what a trend is and how trends change (sharp tick, parabolic, long flat period)

This way you can be agnostic about the future, but you can notice when groups anticipate different futures, identify which group tends to be right, and capitalize on that. 

### Learning

If you want to improve, you need a repeatable process that you can tweak. If you only did something once, it’s very likely that it was just luck and you can’t get better if it’s just luck.

It’s important to let your children know that learning is supposed to be hard, and to model struggling at something and getting it. Don’t give up if you can’t get it right away.

If something is not working, keep trying different things until you find something that works. Then stick to the script. If you’re not sure where to start experimenting, try moving in the opposite direction of what you were doing.

It’s important to distill information down to its essence. Having more pieces of info increases your confidence but not your accuracy (see horse handicapping study). When you only look at a few pieces of information, you can easily tell if you’re right or wrong. A good question to ask is - what do I need to see to change my mind. When you have too much information it’s hard to formulate an answer to that question. “The beginner mind sees many possibilities, the expert sees only a few”.

Learn one thing well. Then you can learn anything well. Don’t branch out too early to too many different topics

The secret to learning a new skill us to rehearse that scale. Break the scale down into subscales and Rehearse one. Rehearsed means to do exactly what you do when you do the actual thing. For example, if it’s ultimate, cut the way you wouldn’t know real game. Don’t cut the terrible practice cutting way.

- brain has two exclusive modes: taking in input and processing that input. If it’s always doing one, it can’t do the other 
- solitude (isolation from input that came from other minds) is crucial
- takeaway - stop listening to podcasts while lifting
- read walden
- the price of something is the amount of “life” required to make and consume it
- our brains evolved to get feedback from other via in-person conversation. You don’t get that through text

## annie Duke hidden forces
- Playing for high stakes gives you more evolutionary pressure to get better
- read the tower and the square by Niall Ferguson 
- read thinking in bets
- use our identity and tribal nature to improve ourselves. Join the tribe that does better or that value is doing better.
- your choices and decisions affect the probability distribution of the future. But the future outcomes are then chosen by luck.
- don’t talk about how unlucky you are. Everyone gets unlucky. Talk about the mistakes you made, what you can learn from them, and how you can improve.
- smarter people tend to be better at fooling themselves and interpreting the numbers to confirm their priors. They are just better with numbers.
- expressing strong certainty shuts down the conversation between ppl who may disagree. Kills curiosity, makes disagreement confrontational, makes good disagreement hard. 
- by signaling that my beliefs are in progress, you’re more willing to give me information I want that may change my mind
- we have to make peace with not knowing

## knowledge project peaceful parenting
- early memories are stored differently
- notice the feelings in your body that arise from the emotions you feel. Label the emotion. It gives you more control over the moment 
- don’t tell kids they are feeling angry
- we can be loving/nurturing and also say no and set boundaries
- help our kids be their best self
- we have to model how to get what we want from others without violence
- kids need to be accepted as they are, need to be delighted in
- love is not happiness. You can love a child without keeping them constantly happy 
- kids want to grow and improve
- help kids choose to give up what they want now for something better later
- acknowledge and accept emotions. Coach them on how to handle the emotion and the consequences of their actions. “I wonder what will happen then”
- let them vent, then help them solve their problem themselves 
- most adults are scared of big emotions. They want to fix them right away. **this is totally true for me.**
- accept their feelings. The feelings are not permanent, they will pass. 
- raises voices causes raised anxiety
- conflict is ok. make sure to work out conflict in front of them (ideally ASAP)
- if you suppress conflict, you will come off as if you cannot manage emotions. Kids won’t trust you. Plus its disingenuous. You have to be honest, or it will erode your relationship. By not addressing it, you’re putting a brick in a wall between you and your partner
- what works is taking responsibility for everything - your actions, your emotions, your thoughts - and dealing with the issue
- help kids build good habits. “What do we do when X”
- as kids get older, they become more social. What their peers are doing may be more important than what you said, or what’s practical 
- responsibility kicks in when they know no one will rescue them. Let them solve their problems. “How are we gonna avoid this problem in the future?”
- kids are prone to avoid responsibility or blame others. To give them responsibility, involve them in the work. Help them craft the system, and slowly remove yourself from the system. 
- if you’ve been doing it all the time, you “are” kinda responsible. But then start training them how to do it themselves. No shame, no blame. Create good habits.

## Dan Harris <> Daniel pink
- great book describe a big idea AND tell you what to do about it. 
- if-then rewards only work on simple tasks with short time horizons, but don’t work on long complex tasks. Rewards are great but only get our attention in very narrow ways. That works when the outcome is obvious. For expansive creative tasks, it hurts you. And it’s hard to sustain motivation with these kinds of rewards 
- enduring performance = autonomy, mastery (progress, improvement), purpose 
- when you write a book or do a big project, you have to live with it for a long time. So only pick things to work on that you’d be happy to live with. 
- jobcrafting - making small changes to make jobs more meaningful 
- find pockets of meaning - small ways to help others 
- everyone is always selling, persuading, cajoling
- LEARN TO SELL BETTER 
- always be closing only works in information asymmetry
- better: atunement (get in their head), bouyancy (stay afloat in ocean of rejection), clarity (go from accessing to curating information, from solving exiting problems to identifying hidden problems)
- don’t catastrophize failure: it’s not personal, pervasive, or permanent. Take a different perspective 
- our energy and focus during the day: peak, trough, recovery 
- vigilance is best in morning. Morning should focus on deep work, analytic work, heads down work
- admin work during trough
- brainstorming is best during recovery (mood is up, vigilance is down)

- learn everything you can on a topic, then question everything on the topic 
- speed of learning is most important. How fast can you go up the learning curve. 

## Master at Scale <> Mark Zuckerberg

- what are ppl interested in? Other ppl. Even in situations where you wouldn't think much about it (a course-matching app for college scheduling), people spend tons of time signaling, watching others, etc.
- facebook is about learning as fast as possible and experimenting
- ship early. ship when you're still somewhat embarrassed by your product. not completely ashamed of it (dont ship crap), but if you wait till its perfect, you've waited too long.
- *note to self:* the above ("move fast, ship early") is something you hear **all** the time. what are the downsides? when is it a mistake to do this?
- yearly mission
- hiring well is #1 when growing
- don’t hire someone to work for you unless you would work for them (in another life)
- when doing an important major rewrite, have the courage to say “no new features” till it’s done, even if it takes years 

## Tyler Cowen <> Jordan Peterson

- learn to assess temperament (as jp defines it) and what it means about the people you work with and what work they're best for
- lesson from Tolkien : go and confront your dragons
- lesson from Harry Potter: voluntary death and rebirth redeems
- he recommends: learn to read, write, speak, communicate, formulate an argument. Read everything that ppl you admire read. Learn from history. choose mentors from the past. Watch/follow people you admire and share their ideas.

- Biggest mistake in life : pessimism 
- you can’t be successful without being quick and decisive. That’s the only way to beat a big org
- the quick and decisive founders answer email WAY faster than others
- important traits: grit, determination, vision of the world that you feel compelled to create, “relentlessly resourceful”, vision, communication, rate of improvement, understanding of human psychology, 
- founders: good leaders. CEOs: good managers. Most ppl are not both
- prototypical founder is James Bond

- Good ideas should be one big thing. Combining two buzzwords = warming sign. 
- poker helps you understand risk (and reading ppl)
- +1 regret minimization 
- +1 doing nothing with ppl you love
- repeated innovation is hard because loss aversion is hard. MOST things in life are not that risky. They are two-way doors. You can come back. 
- assume any criticism is right, reflect on it, then accept or dismiss it
- mimetic stuff (hirers) is super dangerous
- aim for an exponential future, where your next accomplishment could eclipse all your past work combined 
- smart ppl tend to be very mimetic
- less time working on the hard problem everyone’s on, more time working on the new problem that’s gonna matter in 5 years
- coworking spaces kill great ideas, cause reversion to the mean
- joining an early stage startup is just as good as starting it
- see How to Start a Startup course 
- be optimistic. Be around mostly optimistic ppl (10:1). 
- Bowling Alone
- happiness = sense of community 


## tyler cowen <> Atul Gawande

Ask for references when hiring.
Create a success scorecard for each employee BEFORE hiring them, then use it when they are hired. Be clear about goals. 

Stay focused. Say no.

Skin in the game = what ppl do, not what they say
Also, SitG = evolution. If you're not wise, you exit the competition (you are ruined). 
Survivorship bias may not be a bias. You may just not understand why the rule is this way. But if something has been around for a long time, you should pay attention, because it has passed the evolution test and has not edited the system yet (if evolution/competition applies in this domain). 
Because of the minority rule, you cannot study what "most" ppl do in the market and understand the whole market. 
"Playing with house money" is not irrational because it avoids ruin. 
You cannot define "irrational" ex ante. You often do not understand the full system. This is especially true in artificial situations (like scientific experiments). Often there's no real skin in the game. 
"America has a system to destroy the strong". 10% of Americans spend a year in the top 1%, 50% spend a year in the top 10%. There's a lot of transition. You have to look at inequality this way. (Is this because of dominance hierarchy incentives? -grin) 
Skin in the game punishes you even if you're not paying attention 
Risk should be symmetrical. e.g. If you take on risk for others, you should accept that same risk yourself. If you declare war, you should go to war yourself.
Maybe religion is not so irrational. Maybe having strict dietary rules causes groups to eat together and stick together (e.g. Jews)

Debt - claim on future cash flow
Equity - claim on future exit valuation 
Tokens - claim on future value of digital assets (network effect)

List, rank, iterate - how to approach unstructured problems. Put a limit on tries. When you hit the limit, reevaluate. 

Find opportunity by tuning out the valley, set your own path, look at where tech hasn’t gone yet. Satoshi didn’t get the idea for bitcoin by reading hacker news. 

Watson should launch a personal coin as a way to raise money for his project. Coin will pay out a fraction of future earnings, or access to his network. 

Balaji wants to work in blockchain for a while 

When thinking about the future, always think about how much everything will cost.

- don’t rent your time. Own things. You can’t create wealth by getting paid by the hour because leverage is very low. Inputs are too tied to outputs, you’re replaceable, you’re not creative enough
- look for situations where an hour of work can create 1000x value and 1000 hours of work may create no value
- tools, leverage, and creativity are the multipliers that disconnect inputs from outputs
- don’t upgrade your lifestyle too fast. Live below your means. Then you are free.

## Knowledge Project <> Chris Voss

- loss aversion is the biggest driver of human behavior (prospect theory)
- ppl aren’t afraid to fail. They are afraid to fail in a new way. Failing in a socially acceptable way is ok
- BATNAs are a bad idea. They become your target, and as soon as you do better than your target, you’re happy. But you may be leaving money in the table. Hostage negotiators don’t have a BATNA
- start negotiations by laying out a just-the-facts summary of the situation. Avoid spin and self serving framing. Go for something the other side would agree to. 
- next, acknowledge any existing fears. Take the outside view. Even if they don’t actually apply do you, but the other side may think they do, acknowledge them. Don’t deny them, just call them out. let them deny it, then you don’t have to. 
- don’t go first, don’t anchor high. It kills collaboration 
- best way to close is to agree to something the other person suggested. Let them make suggestions and agree to the things that work for you. 
- “how am I supposed to do that” is a good way of saying no that invites the other side to take your perspective and collaborate with you
- look for the win-win
—
- always try to learn something. Genuine curiosity helps remove your ego. Ego is a big reason negotiations fail
- work on the company’s biggest problems. You can’t make them worse (low downside) and if you succeed it’s huge (high upside)
- every time you want something or they want something from you, it’s a negotiation 
- the negatives are bigger. be an proactive listener. Listen for their fear of loss, their negatives. Then deal with them using negotiation tools
- empathy saves time. It lets you root out problems early and find something that works. 
- ppl love when you don’t have to be deferential but you are anyway
- framework: ppl are in 3 categories: fight/flight/make friends 
- “labels” work on everyone. Esp on analysts (flight ppl)
- also getting ppl to say no (by rewording yes questions to no questions) works really well too
- labels / mirrors (repeat the last 1-3 words they just said when you think they said something “crazy”) / calibrated questions work well on kids 
- the act of saying no makes ppl more persuadable because they feel safe when they say no
- read “the dark side of emotional intelligence “ article
- he recommends 7 habits very highly
- never compromise. In theory compromise is you being open to the other side. In practice it’s wearing one black shoe and one brown shoe. 
- he’s fascinated with flow
- meditation = recharge
- tony Robbins puts you in flow.
- everyone can sniff out trust. Substitute “predict” or “predictable” for “trust” and you can figure it out. Look at past behavior. 
- scorpion and frog - if I know they’ll stab me, I can still collaborate with them, but I’d be stupid if I expect to not get stabbed
