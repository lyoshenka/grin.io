Inspired by Tony Sheng’s [book audit](http://www.tonysheng.com/blog/my-annual-book-audit-52-books-and-the-52-ways-they-changed-me-this-year/) ([a](/archive/www.tonysheng.com~blog~my-annual-book-audit-52-books-and-the-52-ways-they-changed-me-this-year.html)), I’m looking to boil each book down to at least one way in which it has affected my thinking, or one change that I will make as a result of reading it. For [Factfulness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness), it’s easy to do - Hans tells you what it is right at the end. I’m going to **start asking what the important facts are, and how many people know them**. And maybe read more outside the US.
