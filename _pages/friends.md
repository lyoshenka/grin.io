Leisurely conversations are rare these days. But I like them and I'd like to have one with you.

Use [this link](https://calendly.com/alexgrin/long-chat) to pick a two-hour chunk of time. We don't have to use it all, but we'll know we don't have any other commitments to distract us.

<small>If you're in the mood for something shorter, here's [my public scheduler](/chat) with more options.</small>
