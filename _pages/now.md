## Here's what I'm up to now

🏡 building [Cabin](https://cabin.city) -- a network city of walkable, long-term neighborhoods where you'd want to grow up.

👪 raising a family with my wife, kids, and some quail.

🍎 living a healthy lifestyle.

🏘️ weaving a [vibrant local community](https://cabin.city/n/spy-pond) near me in Boston, MA, USA.

🫂 hosting IRL events for URL scenes: [Vibecamp](https://vibe.camp), [Farcon](https://farcon.xyz), [TNS Camp](https://tns.camp).

🥏 playing ultimate frisbee.

📚 learning by doing.
