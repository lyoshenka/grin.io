## Here's what I'm up to

🏡 building [Cabin](https://cabin.city) -- a network city of walkable, long-term, values-aligned neighborhoods where you'd want to grow up.

👪 raising a family, a garden, and some quail with my wife and kids.

🏘️  weaving a [vibrant local community](https://fractal.boston) of friendly ambitious nerds in Boston, MA, USA.

🍎 living a healthy lifestyle.

🫂 hosting IRL events for URL scenes: [Vibecamp](https://vibe.camp), [Farcon](https://farcon.xyz), [TNS Camp](https://tns.camp).

🥏 playing ultimate frisbee.

📚 learning by doing.
