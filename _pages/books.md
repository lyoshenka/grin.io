Inspired by Tony Sheng’s [book audit](http://www.tonysheng.com/blog/my-annual-book-audit-52-books-and-the-52-ways-they-changed-me-this-year/) ([a](/archive/www.tonysheng.com~blog~my-annual-book-audit-52-books-and-the-52-ways-they-changed-me-this-year.html)), I’m looking to boil each book down to at least one way in which it has affected my thinking, or one change that I will make as a result of reading it.


Title | Impact
:---  | :---
Factfulness | Start asking what the important facts are, and how many people know them.
Make Time   | Start choosing a Highlight every day, setting aside time to work on it, and reflecting on how that went.
