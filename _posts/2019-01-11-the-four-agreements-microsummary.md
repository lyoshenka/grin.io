In [The Four Agreements](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6596.The_Four_Agreements), Miguel Ruiz invites us to make the following commitments to ourselves:

**Be impeccable with your word.** Try to be honest and true in everything you say. Do not lie, gossip, etc.

**Don’t take anything personally.** You cannot choose what others say or do, but you can choose how you respond to it.

**Don’t make assumptions.** Everyone has their own perspective and understanding of reality, and everyone is wrong much of the time. There is no shame in admitting your mistakes or uncertainty. Have the courage to ask questions and express your thoughts.

**Always do your best.** This one is the most important.Do not compromise.

Adherence to these tenets will improve our lives immensely.
