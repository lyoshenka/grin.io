1. code is debt (and bad code is an [unhedged call option](https://www.castsoftware.com/blog/bad-code-isnt-technical-debt-its-an-unhedged-call-option) ([a](/archive/www.castsoftware.com~blog~bad-code-isnt-technical-debt-its-an-unhedged-call-option.html)))
  - ![cant have 0-days or bugs if I dont write any code](/img/no-bugs.jpg)
  - our users dont care about the code
  - every line of code has costs (your time, readability, maintainability, complexity)
  - its like owning a house with lots of rooms. its nice when your friends come over once a month, but you pay rent every day
  - dont add features unless you're sure it is necessary

2. DRY DRY [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

3. keep it [simple](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md) ([a](/archive/github.com~matthiasn~talk-transcripts~blob~master~Hickey_Rich~SimpleMadeEasy.md.html)) (especially [at first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall.27s_law))

4. be consistent

5. be predictable (aka no magic)

6. no [magic numbers/strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants) â€” use constants instead

7. a good repro is 90% of a bugfix

8. code is written once, but is read many times

9. ship early, ship often

10. first code, then ship, then measure, *then* optimize

11. remember the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), and the [90/90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule)

12. design [layers of abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer) with [deep modules](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs190-winter18/lecture.php?topic=modularDesign) ([a](/archive/web.stanford.edu~~ouster~cgi-bin~cs190-winter18~lecture.php%3ftopic=modularDesign.html))

13. [write tests. not too many. mostly integration.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests) ([a](/archive/kentcdodds.com~blog~write-tests.html))

14. comments should describe [what's not obvious](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs190-winter18/lecture.php?topic=comments) ([a](/archive/web.stanford.edu~~ouster~cgi-bin~cs190-winter18~lecture.php%3ftopic=comments.html)). i used to hate comments but [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design) ([a](/archive/www.goodreads.com~en~book~show~39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design.html)) changed my mind.

15. first you don't know the rules, then you learn the rules, then you break the rules
