- code is debt (and bad code is an [unhedged call option](https://www.castsoftware.com/blog/bad-code-isnt-technical-debt-its-an-unhedged-call-option))
  - ![cant have 0-days or bugs if I dont write any code](/img/no-bugs.jpg)
  - our users dont care about the code
  - every line of code has costs (your time, readability, maintainability, complexity)
    - its like owning a house with lots of rooms. its nice when your friends come over once a month, but you pay rent every day
  - dont add features unless you're sure it is necessary
  - dont optimize prematurely

- DRY DRY [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

- keep it [simple](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md) (especially [at first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall.27s_law))

- be consistent

- be predictable (aka no magic)
    
- no [magic numbers/strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#Unnamed_numerical_constants) â€” use constants instead

- a good repro is 90% of a bugfix

- code is written once, but is read many times

- ship early, ship often

- first code, then ship, then measure, *then* optimize

- remember the [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), and the [90/90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-ninety_rule)

- first you don't know the rules, then you learn the rules, then you break the rules
