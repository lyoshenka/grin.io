- [Ringworld](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61179.Ringworld) by Larry Niven

My favorite books were The Art of Learning and Anything You Want (nonfiction) and Harsh Mistress, Altered Carbon, and Ringworld (fiction). For several of the above books, I started reading them but stopped partway through. Sometimes, this was because I didn't like the book at all (Yiddish Policemen's Union, Mythical Man-Month). Other times, its because the book was interesting at first, but got repetitive (Red Queen). 

Overall, I tried to do two things: alternate fiction and nonfiction, and read award-winning sci-fi. For scifi, I focused on books that won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards. Sadly, that let me down a few times. Yiddish Policemen's Union was especially slow in the beginning, and I could not get into it at all.
