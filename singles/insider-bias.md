Chris Dixon says the next big thing [will look like a toy](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy). That's only true for outsiders. To insiders of that big thing, it will feel like everyone's been talking about it forever. Even after the first wave crests, and the second, and the third, and it becomes mainstream... insiders will continue to misunderstand the growth potential. Weâ€™re still in the early days of the **internet**, never mind crypto.
