title: Snake Country

Yesterday I found out I made Snake Country, one of the top mixed ultimate teams in the country. I'm still floating in the excitement. The
tryout process this year a quite stressful - I'd just moved to a new city and didn't know the teams that well, there are a ton of teams and
they all do tryouts at the same time, and I haven't really been working out as much as I'd like to to feel very confident. The Snake Country
tryouts themselves were a rollercoaster of emotion. The team is very talented, the competition was tough, and the role I was trying to fill
really called on my to be at my best and do something I have historically not been good at. 


This was my first time really trying out for a team in at least five years. The last four, I played on Metro North and there wasn't much
competition for a spot. Before that, I played Amp for several years. While I could have been cut one of the last two years, I never really
felt in danger. The last time I really wasn't sure of my spot was Spinners, where I was one of the last five guys to make it.

This tryout season was complicated in several ways. First, I wasn't even sure how much time I'd be able to dedicate to ultimate, and was
close to not trying out at all. Diana's work demands a lot of her time and she's also studying for the boards, so I eventually realized I
had to put in more time with Zoya to give Diana the time she needed to get her shit done. On top of that, I'm not in peak frisbee shape
anymore. I don't throw much, I don't hit the gym regularly, and even playing myself into shape is not as easy as it was in Philly. 

Part of my stress with Snake Country came from a disappointing tryout with Slow White a few weeks before. Slow was the team I was originally
most excited about. They've been the primiere Boston mixed team for my whole career. I played against them at least once a year for the last
decade, and I've always respected their skill, spirit, and culture. I thought I played reasonably well at their tryout, at least well enough
to get invited back, but they cut me after just one day. I don't blame them (I completely lost focus in the defensive positioning drill),
but it did fill me with doubt about making a top team this year. On the flip side, I think I clearly identified where I slipped up, and
resolved to correct that mistake going forward. Looking back, I think that really helped me going forward.

The next team was Wildcard. Their reputation is youth, discipline, and a big time commitment. I had (and still have) concerns about fitting 
in with their culture, but I was interested in giving it a shot. I didn't feel I played particularly well the first time and was ready for
anyother cut, but they invited me back for a second tryout. That boosted my confidence somewhat. The second time, I thought I played better
and I made that round as well. Sadly, I also realized that 


- cut from slow after just one tryout
- dropped out of wildcard tryouts because of the commitment required
- lantern backup
- only knew a few ppl, but knew they were very good and prolly cliquey
- first year team last year, finished 3rd
- played ok at open tryout. would not have been surprised if they cut me, esp given the level of talent that was there.
- got the invite to Easterns. was told odds were very low (5-6 guys for the single spot). asked for specific feedback and got a very
  detailed response
- played really well at Easterns. one of my best tourneys ever. executed precisely what the feedback asked for.
- felt pretty confident about my game, but not about factors outside my control (who else is trying out)
- got the call, made the team. they liked playing with me, thought i played great, generated Ds and was very reliable on the turn.
- happy to say i succeeded at something I've not done well in the past - playing turnover-free ultimate as a handler.
- dug deep in my bag of mental toughness practice: asked for feedback, reread it to stay focused, did a bit of positive visualization,
  focused on things that were under my control.
- really enjoyed the people on the team - talented, nice people, positive attitude. 
- just the beginning. now need to continue to challenge myself to perform, and up my game.
