What's important to me in starting to work on something new:

## Joy From Regular Use

I want to make somethign that my friends and I will love to use on a regular basis (daily or at most weekly). This basically puts me in the
realm of consumer tech, but it could be tech aimed at devs. Or even be a decentralized protocol that underlies the tech. But in that case
I'd want to also build an app on the protocol.

Or it could be something more community-focused. But the same principle applies there: I'd want to engage with the community daily or
weekly, and want others to engage as well. Otherwise its not fun.

## A Big Bet

I always like to make an asymmetric bet on myself in the work I do. In work this generally means I'm founding a company or getting in early,
or I'm taking a very senior role. Ideally I'd want at least 1% equity, but without underpaying myself too much like I have been in the past.

## Follow the Fun

If it's not fun, it's not worth it. I haven't felt this excited for new work in a long time.

## Market Timing

One of Kevin Systrom's criteria for a new startup is catching a wave in the market. So either taking advantage of a new technology that's on
the horizon, or a new cultural phenomenon, or something else that will push the company forward rather than drag it down.

## Hard Technical Problems

This is my zone of genius. Though I'm also good at connecting those problems to the overall context (business, strategy). And actually I've
been finding I really like strategy discussions. So maybe my focus needs to shift.

## Health, Family, Work

The project must be balanced against my own health and my relationships with family/friends/community. I'm not interested in
around-the-clock work, chronic stress (occaisional acute stress is good). I need time to wind down, work out, play with my kids, and so on.

Josh Waitzkin talks about how most ppl go through life at a constant 4-7 intensity level, and how he wants to only alternate between 10 and 0.
When he's on, he's 100% on. When he's off, he's in deep relaxation and recovery mode.
